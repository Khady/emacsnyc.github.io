> Ray will show us his implementation of turtle graphics in emacs and
> take us under the shell to see how it works. [Turtle graphics] are a
> way of drawing pictures in which one provides a series of directions
> such as "move forward" or "turn left" to steer the pen. (The name
> comes from the fact that the original implementation involved a
> robotic turtle as output device controlled by the computer.) In
> addition to providing a useful and entertaining program, this talk
> will also discuss techniques of pbm graphics and the use of a buffer
> for drawing which are of general use when doing graphics in emacs.
