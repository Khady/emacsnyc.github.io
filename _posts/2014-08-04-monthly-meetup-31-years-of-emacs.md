Notice that this month we'll be trying out a new location (where we
can come in through the front door!)

As usual, we'll be starting at 6:30 with pizza and beer.

Perry Metzger will be presenting on *31 Years of Emacs*:

> Perry Metzger has been using Emacs as his text editor since early
> September, 1983 -- nearly 31 years. Over much of that time, it has
> also been his primary way to read email, compile programs, and
> perform a variety of other tasks.
>
> Why would anyone use a single program for that long? This talk is
> partially intended to answer that question.
>
> Emacs remains one of the most important user interfaces (and text
> editors) for computer professionals almost 40 years after it was
> created. The talk is intended to be part history, part philosophy,
> and part speculation on the future. It will also teach Emacs fans
> how to explain to their skeptical friends why it is still a good
> idea to learn a tool from the terminal era that requires
> memorization of dozens of control sequences in an age of GUIs and
> smart phones.
>
> Perry is (among other things) a programmer, a computer security
> consultant, and a doctoral student at the University of
> Pennsylvania. When he started using Emacs in 1983, it was still
> written in TECO, and portions of his Emacs init file date
> to 1985. He expects to still be using Emacs for decades to come.
