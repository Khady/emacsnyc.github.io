Diego Berrocal [website][1] [twitter][2] [github][3] will be
presenting `Getting Closer to Using Emacs as an IDE(or better)`

> I'll demonstrate how my setup has become more of an IDE gradually
> because of the different plugins I use and how it has changed
> dramatically thanks to the Language Server Protocol by Microsoft
> (which will be the focus of this talk).
