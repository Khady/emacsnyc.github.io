> The amazing Emacs org-mode has myriad uses and features including
> outlining, note-taking, table management, and publishing to HTML and
> LaTeX. It's also a fabulous tool to help make your research
> reproducible. From [Wikipedia]:

>> In 2012, a survey done for Nature found that
>> [47 out of 53 medical research papers on the subject of cancer were irreproducible]... Researchers
>> explained in a 2006 study that, of 249 data sets from American
>> Psychology Association (APA) empirical articles,
>> [73% of contacted authors did not respond with their data] over a
>> 6-month period.

> Org-mode allows authors to include their datasets and all programs
> that were run to generate figures and text. Included files can be
> used to facilitate version control. While there are limits to this
> approach---including data generation and software versioning---it
> represents a big advance in reproducibility and one which has not
> yet been widely adopted.
