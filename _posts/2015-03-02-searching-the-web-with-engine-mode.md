> I probably spend about 75% of my programming time looking up
> documentation. That's really easy in Emacs Lisp---my documentation
> is built into my editor---but in most other languages I'm not so
> lucky.

> I wrote [engine-mode] to help fix this problem. It's a simple minor
> mode that lets me define arbitrary search engines and send snippets
> of text to them from within Emacs. Now I don't have to copy and
> paste text between my browser and editor! So fancy.

> We'll be talking about how to get started with engine-mode (it's
> easy!) and then digging into the implementation and discussing the
> process of committing a package to MELPA.
