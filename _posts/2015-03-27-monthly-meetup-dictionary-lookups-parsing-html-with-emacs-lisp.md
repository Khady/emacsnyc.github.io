Steve B. from the [OSFDA] will be presenting *Dictionary Lookups:
Parsing HTML with Emacs Lisp*:

> Steve goes into the Emacs trenches and shows how to use elisp to
> reformat HTML markup from the Free Dictionary (one of the finest
> open dictionaries and thesauri on the Internet), so now you can
> directly query it when you're at a loss for words in Emacs.

> After the presentation, the code will be released for free download
> to anyone wanting to use it. Steve is an avid digital currency
> application developer, and has used Emacs since 1982 (including Gold
> Hill lisp...)
