We're starting at 6:30pm, as always we will have pizza and beer!

We're doing a hack night! Theme is TBD, but you can work on whatever.

Rules of the hack night are simple. You bring a project to work on, we'll have a brief standup to talk about what we're doing and get to work.

Ask for help if you'd like or work with someone that is doing something interesting.

If you have something really interesting please feel free to share it with the rest of the group.
