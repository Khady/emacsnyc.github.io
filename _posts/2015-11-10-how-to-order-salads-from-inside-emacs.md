As usual, we'll be starting at 6:30 with pizza and beer!

Diego Berrocal [website][1] [twitter][2] [github][3] is a Recurser at the Recurse Center and he will be teaching us how to order salad using Emacs

>I have been eating exclusively salads the past few weeks, and I have been using emacs for programming that whole time.  It was about time I merged those interests together. I'll show how I used the request.el library and dash.el to have a more functional paradigm.
