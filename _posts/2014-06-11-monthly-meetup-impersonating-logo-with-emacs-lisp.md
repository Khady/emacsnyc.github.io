As usual, we'll be starting at 6:30 with pizza and beer!

[Ray Puzio](http://emacsturtle.metameso.org) will be presenting on *Emacs Mutant Anime Turtles: Impersonating Logo with Emacs Lisp*:

> Ray will show us his implementation of turtle graphics in emacs and take us under the shell to see how it works. [Turtle graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics) are a way of drawing pictures in which one provides a series of directions such as "move forward" or "turn left" to steer the pen. (The name comes from the fact that the original implementation involved a robotic turtle as output device controlled by the computer.) In addition to providing a useful and entertaining program, this talk will also discuss techniques of pbm graphics and the use of a buffer for drawing which are of general use when doing graphics in emacs.
