As usual, we'll be starting at 6:30 with pizza and beer!

[Zachary Kanfer](http://zck.me) will be giving a talk on writing games with Emacs:

> Games are a great way to get started writing programs in any language. In Emacs Lisp, they're even betterâ€”you use the same exact techniques to extend Emacs, configuring it to do what you want. In this presentation, I livecode tic-tac-toe. You'll see how to create a basic major mode, make functions, store state, and set keybindings.
