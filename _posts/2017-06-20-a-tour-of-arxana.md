Ray Puzio will be presenting *A Tour of Arxana*

> The topography of knowledge can be quite intricate, with assertions
> linking not only to objects of knowledge, but also to other assertions
> and even linking to links.  In order to adequately represent and
> reason about such situations, Joe Corneli and Ray Puzio have been
> developing a hypertext system called Arxana.
>
> Inspired by Ted Nelson's projects Xanadu and implemented in Emacs
> Lisp, this system is based upon representing hypergraphs with a
> generalization of CONS cells.  In this talk, Ray will give a tour of
> Arxana both under the hood and behind the wheel and round it off with
> a scenic drive through some applications to the study of mathematical
> exposition which he and Joe are working on.
