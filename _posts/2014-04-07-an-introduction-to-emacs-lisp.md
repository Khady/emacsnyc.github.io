> Emacs can be thought of as a big Lisp interpreter, so you can't
> master Emacs without learning some Emacs Lisp. We'll be introducing
> Emacs Lisp by describing its simple syntax, demonstrating a few Lisp
> functions for manipulating buffers, regions, and strings, writing a
> few utility functions, and binding those functions to custom
> keys. By the end of the talk, you should able to do the same.
