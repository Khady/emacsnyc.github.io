> With a little effort, Emacs can be a powerful, multi-language IDE
> with code completion, documentation lookup, and more. Taking Python
> as our language, we will show how to use the the auto-complete, epc,
> and jedi.el libraries to create a semantically rich editing
> experience. Weâ€™ll discuss how these libraries work together and how
> to customize them for your own setup.

Drew has also made his [slides] available.
