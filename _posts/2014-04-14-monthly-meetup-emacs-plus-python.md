We'll be starting at 6:30 with pizza and beer. Drew Werner will be giving a full-length talk, and we'll also have a lightning talk by Evan Misshula.

Drew Werner ([twitter](https://twitter.com/wernerdrew), [github](https://github.com/wernerandrew)) will be talking about using Emacs as a Python IDE:

> With a little effort, Emacs can be a powerful, multi-language IDE with code completion, documentation lookup, and more. Taking Python as our language, we will show how to use the the auto-complete, epc, and jedi.el libraries to create a semantically rich editing experience. Weâ€™ll discuss how these libraries work together and how to customize them for your own setup.

[Evan Misshula](http://johnjayresearch.org/rec/) will be giving a lightning talk on *The best of both worlds: Combining the best  REPL (IPython 2.0) and Editor (Emacs):*

> Evan will provide an introduction to incremental analysis through IPython moderated by the editing features of Emacs. A brief introduction to integrating with Org-mode will also be given. Advantages over the R console and Bash shell will be discussed.
