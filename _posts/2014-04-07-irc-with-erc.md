> Internet Relay Chat (IRC) has been a popular P2P messaging system
> since 1988. Since it uses a text-based interface, it's a perfect fit
> for Emacs! We'll be looking at ERC, the built-in Emacs IRC client
> and the solution to all our social needs. ERC easily fits into
> anyone's workflow and has tons of libraries to make it even more
> seamless.
