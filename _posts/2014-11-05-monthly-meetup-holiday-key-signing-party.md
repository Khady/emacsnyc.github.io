Happy Holidays, folks! Let's get paranoid!

This month we're focusing on security. [George Brocklehurst] will be
giving an introductory talk/workshop on PGP, and afterward we'll be
hosting a [key signing party]! As ever, thoughtbot will be providing
pizza and beer.

George will be introducing PGP: creating a key, uploading it, signing
keys, the web of trust, and sending encrypted mail.

We may also have a brief lightning talk on integrating PGP with Gnus.

For the key signing party, please remember to bring:

* A couple forms of photo identification
* Pencil and paper, a laptop, or a camera, to record others' key
  fingerprints
* Your key's fingerprint, if you've already set one up

Don't worry if you don't already have a key; George's talk should get
you all set up. If you'd like to create your key and try out PGP
beforehand, though, check out Caleb Thompson's terrific blog post,
[PGP and You].

Finally, if you're on [meetup.com], please remember to RSVP! The
building's security is a little paranoid, and everything will be much
easier if your name is on the guest list.
