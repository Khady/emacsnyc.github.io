[Jacob O'Donnell]

> Keyboard macros are a powerful Emacs feature. A keyboard macro is
> simply a recording of a sequence of key sequences that can be played
> back and repeated. In this meetup we will first go over the
> different keyboard macro commands Emacs has to offer. In the second
> half of the meetup we will solve a couple repetitive text
> manipulation tasks using macros.

If you'd like to get some directed practice using keyboard macros,
Jacob hosts a [collection of sample exercises]. We also mirror those
exercises here in [.zip] or [.tar.gz] formats, if you'd prefer.

He's also made his [org slides] available.
