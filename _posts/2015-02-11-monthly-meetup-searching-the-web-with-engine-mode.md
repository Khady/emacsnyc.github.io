[Jonathan Magen] will be presenting *How I Use org-capture and Stuff*:

> Org-capture is a great way to take notes and plan in Emacs. Capture
> templates provide a flexible way to extend org-capture and
> personalize the way you record various bits of information. This
> talk will cover how Jonathan uses org-capture and provide an intro
> to writing your own org-capture templates.

[Harry Schwartz] will be presenting on *Searching the Web with
engine-mode*:

> I probably spend about 75% of my programming time looking up
> documentation. That's really easy in Emacs Lisp---my documentation
> is built into my editor--but in most other languages I'm not so
> lucky.

> I wrote [engine-mode] to help fix this problem. It's a simple minor
> mode that lets me define arbitrary search engines and send snippets
> of text to them from within Emacs. Now I don't have to copy and
> paste text between my browser and editor! So fancy.

> We'll be talking about how to get started with engine-mode (it's
> easy!) and then digging into the implementation and discussing the
> process of committing a package to MELPA.
