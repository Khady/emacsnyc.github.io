As usual, we'll be starting at 6:30 with pizza and beer.

[Jacob O'Donnell](http://www.jacobodonnell.com/) will be giving a talk
and hosting a workshop on advanced features of keyboard macros. Bring
your laptops!

> Keyboard macros are a powerful Emacs feature. A keyboard macro is
> simply a recording of a sequence of key sequences that can be played
> back and repeated. In this meetup we will first go over the
> different keyboard macro commands Emacs has to offer.  In the second
> half of the meetup we will solve a couple repetitive text
> manipulation tasks using macros.
