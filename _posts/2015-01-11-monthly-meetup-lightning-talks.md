This month we are doing lightning talks! The theme is how you use emacs in your day-to-day. You are welcome to give another lightning talk if you feel so inspired.

You can give a talk that is no more than 5 minutes in length.

(Contact us)[mailto:admin@emacsnyc.org] if you'd like to give a talk!

As usual, we'll be starting at 6:30 with pizza and beer!

If you would like to give a lightning talk please feel free to come on up and speak. We will have everything set up for you when you get here.

If you would like to speak then or on any other occasion, take a look at this [guide](/giving-a-talk.html).
