Rocky Bernstein will talk about what bytecode is, its value, and its
limitations. Focusing primarily on the Emacs bytecode runtime, heâ€™ll
compare it to other implementations of elisp bytecode, such as [Emacs in
Rust]

Rocky Bernstein ([github]) is a long time emacs user, prolific
developer, and is heavily involved in the free software community. He
wrote and maintains [realgud] and literally wrote the book on [Emacs
Lisp Bytecode]
