We're starting at 6:30pm, as always we will have pizza and beer!

Aldric [website][github] will be giving a talk about creating sqlup, creating minor modes and distributing them.

> This talk will take you through the creation of a minor mode and its
> distribution through MELPA. It will cover the fundamentals of the
> creation of a minor mode, some useful emacs hooks, some of the
> problems I've run into with this particular mode and how I've chosen
> to approach them, as well as the process of getting the package up on
> MELPA.
