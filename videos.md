**Emacs as a Python IDE**<br />
Drew Werner ([twitter](https://twitter.com/wernerdrew), [github](https://github.com/wernerandrew))<br />
<time datetime="2014-05-05">05 May 2014</time>

> With a little effort, Emacs can be a powerful, multi-language IDE with code completion, documentation lookup, and more. Taking Python as our language, we will show how to use the the auto-complete, epc, and jedi.el libraries to create a semantically rich editing experience. Weâ€™ll discuss how these libraries work together and how to customize them for your own setup.

Drew has also made his [slides](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emacsnyc/documents/using-emacs-as-a-python-ide.pdf) available.

**Upgrading IPython with Emacs**<br />
[Evan Misshula](http://johnjayresearch.org/rec/)<br />
<time datetime="2014-05-05">05 May 2014</time>

> Evan will provide an introduction to incremental analysis through IPython moderated by the editing features of Emacs. A brief introduction to integrating with Org-mode will also be given. Advantages over the R console and Bash shell will be discussed.

Evan has made his [slides](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emacsnyc/documents/upgrading-ipython-with-emacs.org) (in `org-mode`!) available.

**IRC With ERC**<br />
[Eric Collins](http://tabfugni.cc)<br />
<time datetime="2014-04-07">07 Apr 2014</time>

> Internet Relay Chat (IRC) has been a popular P2P messaging system since 1988. Since it uses a text-based interface, it's a perfect fit for Emacs! We'll be looking at ERC, the built-in Emacs IRC client and the solution to all our social needs. ERC easily fits into anyone's workflow and has tons of libraries to make it even more seamless.

**An Introduction to Emacs Lisp**<br />
[Harry Schwartz](http://harryrschwartz.com)<br />
<time datetime="2014-04-07">07 Apr 2014</time>

> Emacs can be thought of as a big Lisp interpreter, so you can't master Emacs without learning some Emacs Lisp. We'll be introducing Emacs Lisp by describing its simple syntax, demonstrating a few Lisp functions for manipulating buffers, regions, and strings, writing a few utility functions, and binding those functions to custom keys. By the end of the talk, you should able to do the same.

This talk was also turned into a [blog post](http://harryrschwartz.com/2014/04/08/an-introduction-to-emacs-lisp.html).
