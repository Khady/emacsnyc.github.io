**Searching the web with engine-mode**<br>
[Harry Schwartz](http://harryrschwartz.com)<br>
<time datetime="2015-03-02">02 March 2015</time>

> I probably spend about 75% of my programming time looking up
> documentation. That's really easy in Emacs Lisp---my documentation
> is built into my editor---but in most other languages I'm not so
> lucky.

> I wrote [engine-mode](http://github.com/hrs/engine-mode) to help fix
> this problem. It's a simple minor mode that lets me define arbitrary
> search engines and send snippets of text to them from within
> Emacs. Now I don't have to copy and paste text between my browser
> and editor! So fancy.

> We'll be talking about how to get started with engine-mode (it's
> easy!) and then digging into the implementation and discussing the
> process of committing a package to MELPA.

[Jonathan Magen](http://yonkeltron.com/)<br>
<time datetime="2015-03-02">02 March 2015</time>

> Org-capture is a great way to take notes and plan in Emacs. Capture
> templates provide a flexible way to extend org-capture and
> personalize the way you record various bits of information. This
> talk will cover how Jonathan uses org-capture and provide an intro
> to writing your own org-capture templates.

**Org-mode for Reproducible Research**<br>
[Evan Misshula](https://evanmisshula.github.io/)<br>
<time datetime="2014-11-03">03 November 2014</time>

> The amazing Emacs org-mode has myriad uses and features including
> outlining, note-taking, table management, and publishing to HTML and
> LaTeX. It's also a fabulous tool to help make your research
> reproducible. From [Wikipedia]:

>> In 2012, a survey done for Nature found that
>> [47 out of 53 medical research papers on the subject of cancer were irreproducible]... Researchers
>> explained in a 2006 study that, of 249 data sets from American
>> Psychology Association (APA) empirical articles,
>> [73% of contacted authors did not respond with their data] over a
>> 6-month period.

> Org-mode allows authors to include their datasets and all programs
> that were run to generate figures and text. Included files can be
> used to facilitate version control. While there are limits to this
> approach---including data generation and software versioning---it
> represents a big advance in reproducibility and one which has not
> yet been widely adopted.

**Keyboard Macro Workshop**<br>
[Jacob O'Donnell](http://www.jacobodonnell.com/)<br>
<time datetime="2014-10-06">06 October 2014</time>

> Keyboard macros are a powerful Emacs feature. A keyboard macro is simply a recording of a sequence of key sequences that can be played back and repeated. In this meetup we will first go over the different keyboard macro commands Emacs has to offer. In the second half of the meetup we will solve a couple repetitive text manipulation tasks using macros.

If you'd like to get some directed practice using keyboard macros, Jacob hosts a [collection of sample exercises](http://emacs-macros.herokuapp.com/). We also mirror those exercises here in [.zip](/assets/documents/keyboard-macro-workshop-exercises.zip) or [.tar.gz](/assets/documents/keyboard-macro-workshop-exercises.tar.gz) formats, if you'd prefer.

He's also made his [org slides](/assets/documents/keyboard-macro-workshop-notes.org) available.

**The Editor of a Lifetime**<br>
Perry Metzger<br>
<time datetime="2014-08-11">11 August 2014</time>

> Perry Metzger has been using Emacs as his text editor since early September, 1983&mdash;nearly 31 years. Over much of that time, it has also been his primary way to read email, compile programs, and perform a variety of other tasks.

> Why would anyone use a single program for that long? This talk is partially intended to answer that question.

> Emacs remains one of the most important user interfaces (and text editors) for computer professionals almost 40 years after it was created. The talk is intended to be part history, part philosophy, and part speculation on the future. It will also teach Emacs fans how to explain to their skeptical friends why it is still a good idea to learn a tool from the terminal era that requires memorization of dozens of control sequences in an age of GUIs and smart phones.

> Perry is (among other things) a programmer, a computer security consultant, and a doctoral student at the University of Pennsylvania. When he started using Emacs in 1983, it was still written in TECO, and portions of his Emacs init file date to 1985. He expects to still be using Emacs for decades to come.

Perry has also made his [slides](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emacsnyc/documents/emacs-the-editor-of-a-lifetime.pdf) available.

**Emacs Mutant Anime Turtles: Impersonating Logo with Emacs Lisp**<br>
Ray Puzio<br>
<time datetime="2014-07-07">07 July 2014</time>

> Ray will show us his implementation of turtle graphics in emacs and take us under the shell to see how it works. [Turtle graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics) are a way of drawing pictures in which one provides a series of directions such as "move forward" or "turn left" to steer the pen. (The name comes from the fact that the original implementation involved a robotic turtle as output device controlled by the computer.) In addition to providing a useful and entertaining program, this talk will also discuss techniques of pbm graphics and the use of a buffer for drawing which are of general use when doing graphics in emacs.

Ray has posted his [notes and code](http://emacsturtle.metameso.org).

**Writing Games in Emacs**<br>
[Zachary Kanfer](http://zck.me/)<br>
<time datetime="2014-06-02">02 June 2014</time>

> Games are a great way to get started writing programs in any language. In Emacs Lisp, they're even betterâ€”you use the same exact techniques to extend Emacs, configuring it to do what you want. In this presentation, I livecode tic-tac-toe. You'll see how to create a basic major mode, make functions, store state, and set keybindings.

Zachary has posted his [code](http://zck.me/tictactoe/tictactoe.el).

**Introduction to evil-mode**<br>
[Bailey Ling](http://bling.github.io)<br>
<time datetime="2014-06-02">02 June 2014</time>

> Bailey will provide a lightning talk on evil-mode, aptly named after the editor of the beast. He'll show why evil-mode can make Vim veterans feel at home while exposing them to the power available in Emacs.

Bailey has made his [org slides](https://gist.github.com/bling/ab8b83c60686b3653828) available.

**Emacs as a Python IDE**<br>
Drew Werner ([twitter](https://twitter.com/wernerdrew), [github](https://github.com/wernerandrew))<br>
<time datetime="2014-05-05">05 May 2014</time>

> With a little effort, Emacs can be a powerful, multi-language IDE with code completion, documentation lookup, and more. Taking Python as our language, we will show how to use the the auto-complete, epc, and jedi.el libraries to create a semantically rich editing experience. Weâ€™ll discuss how these libraries work together and how to customize them for your own setup.

Drew has also made his [slides](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emacsnyc/documents/using-emacs-as-a-python-ide.pdf) available.

**Upgrading IPython with Emacs**<br>
[Evan Misshula](http://johnjayresearch.org/rec/)<br>
<time datetime="2014-05-05">05 May 2014</time>

> Evan will provide an introduction to incremental analysis through IPython moderated by the editing features of Emacs. A brief introduction to integrating with Org-mode will also be given. Advantages over the R console and Bash shell will be discussed.

Evan has made his [slides](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emacsnyc/documents/upgrading-ipython-with-emacs.org) (in `org-mode`!) available.

**IRC With ERC**<br>
[Eric Collins](http://tabfugni.cc)<br>
<time datetime="2014-04-07">07 Apr 2014</time>

> Internet Relay Chat (IRC) has been a popular P2P messaging system since 1988. Since it uses a text-based interface, it's a perfect fit for Emacs! We'll be looking at ERC, the built-in Emacs IRC client and the solution to all our social needs. ERC easily fits into anyone's workflow and has tons of libraries to make it even more seamless.

The awesome [Sacha Chua](http://sachachua.com/blog/) has contributed a [transcript of this talk](http://emacslife.com/transcripts/2014-04-07%20Emacs%20NYC%20-%20IRC%20with%20ERC%20-%20Eric%20Collins.html).

**An Introduction to Emacs Lisp**<br>
[Harry Schwartz](http://harryrschwartz.com)<br>
<time datetime="2014-04-07">07 Apr 2014</time>

> Emacs can be thought of as a big Lisp interpreter, so you can't master Emacs without learning some Emacs Lisp. We'll be introducing Emacs Lisp by describing its simple syntax, demonstrating a few Lisp functions for manipulating buffers, regions, and strings, writing a few utility functions, and binding those functions to custom keys. By the end of the talk, you should able to do the same.

This talk was also turned into a [blog post](http://harryrschwartz.com/2014/04/08/an-introduction-to-emacs-lisp.html), and the [source code](https://gist.github.com/hrs/d187c8652951897da9ac) is available.
