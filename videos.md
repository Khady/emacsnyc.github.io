**IRC With ERC**<br />
[Eric Collins](http://tabfugni.cc)<br />
<time datetime="2014-04-07">07 Apr 2014</time>

> Internet Relay Chat (IRC) has been a popular P2P messaging system since 1988. Since it uses a text-based interface, it's a perfect fit for Emacs! We'll be looking at ERC, the built-in Emacs IRC client and the solution to all our social needs. ERC easily fits into anyone's workflow and has tons of libraries to make it even more seamless.

**An Introduction to Emacs Lisp**<br />
[Harry Schwartz](http://harryrschwartz.com)<br />
<time datetime="2014-04-07">07 Apr 2014</time>

> Emacs can be thought of as a big Lisp interpreter, so you can't master Emacs without learning some Emacs Lisp. We'll be introducing Emacs Lisp by describing its simple syntax, demonstrating a few Lisp functions for manipulating buffers, regions, and strings, writing a few utility functions, and binding those functions to custom keys. By the end of the talk, you should able to do the same.

This talk was also turned into a [blog post](http://harryrschwartz.com/2014/04/08/an-introduction-to-emacs-lisp.html).
