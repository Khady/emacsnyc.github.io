* Emacs Macros
** What is a Macro
*** A macro is a way to record your keystrokes and play them back.
*** While you are defining your macro you are also executing it the first time
*** Macros excel at text manipulation tasks
**** Tend to be for more disposable tasks
**** They are not very fast, and have no progress bar
*** Macro replacements
**** replace-string
**** replace-regexp
**** ELisp
**** Snippets
** Macro basics
*** C-x (			  - kmacro-start-macro
*** C-x )			  - kmacro-end-macro
*** <F3>			  - kmacro-start-macro-or-insert-counter
*** <F4>			  - kmacro-end-or-call-macro
*** C-g				  - keyboard-quit
*** C-x e			  - kmacro-end-and-call-macro
**** You can just hit e again to repeat
**** This command takes the universal argument (0) repeats for infinity
*** C-u C-x C-( - kmacro-start-macro, allows you to append to the end of the last macro
*** C-x C-k r	  - apply-macro-to-region-lines
** How to think when writing a macro
*** Be careful using movement commands/prefer search
*** Look for patterns that should hold true every time
*** Break your macro apart into multiple steps
*** Make sure to end the macro in the same state as the beginning so it is repeatable
