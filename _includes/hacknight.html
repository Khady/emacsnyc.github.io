This month we are having a hack night.

Participation is pretty simple:

<ul>
  <li>Try to bring a project work on</li>
  <li>If you don't have a project, be eager to work with someone</li>
  <li>Come prepared to work with others</li>
  <li>Find people to help you or find a project that's interesting to work on</li>
  <li>There will be a brief standup to get things going and introduce yourself and your project to others</li>
</ul>
