### We're the Emacs meetup in NYC!

We get together the first Monday of every month. We have some pizza and drinks and listen to an Emacs-related talk or two. Fun times are had by all. =)

Talks are recorded. We post the videos on YouTube for streaming. We also release the [videos for download] in a free format.

Announcements of new meetings and talk descriptions are posted on our [meetup.com group]. We also cross-post them here on our blog, if you prefer RSS and/or don't want to get a meetup.com account.

The group is sponsored by [thoughtbot], which provides the pizza, beer, and space.

### Who's doing this?

We're [Eric] and [Zachary], a couple of developers and Emacs enthusiasts.
